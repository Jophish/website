      <p>I'm <strong>Joe</strong>.</p>
    <p> I'm known by a few names, my real life one is Joe Bergeron (my middle initial is "A"). On the internet some people know me as <strong>Mornings</strong>, and the really crufty ones know me as <strong>Jophish</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>I like <strong>music</strong> and <strong>computer science</strong> and <strong>math</strong> and <strong>origami</strong>, sometimes all at once. Really I just like making stuff. I live in Cambridge, MA and study electrical engineering, computer science, and mathematics at MIT, but who knows what will happen next?</p>

    <p>I also like playing <strong>Go</strong>.</p>
